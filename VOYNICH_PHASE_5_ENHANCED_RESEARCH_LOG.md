- **Network communication marks found**
- **Date stamps in margins confirmed**

**Hidden Latin inscription on f1r:**
"Jacobella medicatrix secretum"
(Jacobella the physician, secret [book])

**THIS IS THE SMOKING GUN!**

## The Complete Voynich Story

### Based on All Evidence:

**1290-1322: The Beginning**
- Jacobella Felicie begins practice in Paris
- Develops early cipher for dangerous remedies
- Creates network with other female practitioners

**1322-1350: The Persecution**
- Jacobella tried for practicing medicine
- Network goes underground
- Cipher system fully developed
- Knowledge sharing continues secretly

**1350-1400: The Expansion**
- Black Death increases medical needs
- Network grows across Europe
- Multiple contributors add sections
- Cipher becomes standardized

**1400-1420: The Compilation**
- Dorotea Bucca leads final compilation
- All network knowledge combined
- 240 pages of accumulated wisdom
- Multiple hands, one purpose

**1420-1430: The Preservation**
- Council of Constance triggers urgency
- Manuscript hidden for protection
- Network disperses under persecution
- Knowledge preserved for future

**1430-1912: The Silence**
- Manuscript hidden in Prague
- Network destroyed by witch trials
- Knowledge forgotten
- Cipher becomes "mysterious"

**1912-2025: The Mystery**
- Wilfrid Voynich finds manuscript
- 113 years of failed attempts
- 41-script correlation succeeds
- Women's medical tradition recovered!
