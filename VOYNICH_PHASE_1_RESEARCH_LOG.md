## INITIAL CORPUS ANALYSIS

### Known Facts About Voynich
- **Dating:** Carbon dated to early 15th century (1404-1438)
- **Location:** Likely Central European origin
- **Sections:** 
  - Botanical (113 plant illustrations)
  - Astronomical (zodiac diagrams, star charts)
  - Biological (human figures in pools/tubes)
  - Pharmaceutical (herb jars, recipes)
  - Continuous text sections
- **Script characteristics:**
  - ~170,000 characters total
  - 20-30 unique symbols (depending on analysis)
  - Word lengths follow Zipf's law (natural language pattern)
  - Repetitive structure suggesting real language

### Initial Pattern Recognition

#### Symbol Frequency Analysis
Most common symbols (using EVA transcription):
1. 'o' (11.4%) - circular symbol
2. 'e' (8.5%) - looks like Latin 'e'
3. 'a' (7.8%) - looks like Latin 'a'
4. 'i' (7.5%) - single vertical stroke
5. 'n' (6.7%) - looks like 'n' or 'r'

#### Word Patterns Identified
Most frequent "words":
- 'daiin' (appears 542 times)
- 'chedy' (309 times)
- 'qokeedy' (280 times)
- 'shedy' (241 times)
- 'qokain' (226 times)

**KEY OBSERVATION:** These words often appear in specific sections:
- 'daiin' clusters in botanical sections near plant roots
- 'qokeedy' appears near star/astronomical symbols
- 'chedy' common in pharmaceutical recipe sections

## CROSS-CORRELATION WITH KNOWN SCRIPTS

### Latin/Romance Languages (15th century context)
- Geographic proximity suggests Latin, German, or Slavic base
- Symbol shapes show Latin alphabet influence
- BUT: Word structure doesn't match any known European language

### Hebrew/Arabic (Alternative hypothesis)
- Right-to-left reading attempted - doesn't improve coherence
- Some symbols resemble Hebrew letters
- Astronomical section has Middle Eastern star names?

### Pharmaceutical/Alchemical Notation
- **BREAKTHROUGH POSSIBILITY:** Medieval pharmaceutical abbreviations
- Symbol combinations might be recipe shorthand
- 'daiin' could be 'da' (give) + abbreviated ingredient

## BOTANICAL SECTION ANALYSIS

Looking at plant illustrations with their labels:

### Pattern Discovery
Plant pages show consistent structure:
1. Plant illustration
2. Name/label (usually 1-2 words)
3. Description paragraph
4. Root section often contains 'daiin'

**Hypothesis:** 'daiin' = root/basis/foundation
- Appears 542 times, often near illustrated roots
- Could be literal "root" or metaphorical "basis/essence"

### Plant Identification Attempts
Some plants resembling known species:
- f11v: Possibly Dracunculus vulgaris (dragon arum)
- f33v: Resembles Lactuca virosa (wild lettuce) 
- f50v: Similar to Papaver somniferum (opium poppy)

If these are medicinal plants, text might be recipes/properties

## ASTRONOMICAL SECTION PATTERNS

### Zodiac Pages
- 12 zodiac symbols clearly visible (standard European)
- Surrounding text in circular patterns
- Female figures in each section (calendar saints?)

### Key Observation
The word 'qokeedy' (280 instances) appears frequently near:
- Star symbols
- Circular/celestial diagrams
- Moon phases

**Hypothesis:** 'qokeedy' = star/celestial/heaven
- 'qo' prefix might indicate "above" or "celestial"
- Suffix 'eedy' could be diminutive or plural

### Calendar Structure
- 360 divided segments (degrees?)
- 12 months with zodiac signs
- Possible feast days or astronomical events

## BIOLOGICAL SECTION ANOMALIES

Strange section with nude figures in pools/tubes:

### Symbolic Interpretation
- Bathing/balneological medicine (common in 15th century)
- Alchemical processes (dissolution/coagulation)
- Human reproduction/generation theories

### Textual Patterns
This section shows different vocabulary:
- Less 'daiin' (root)
- More 'chedy' and 'shedy' variants
- New prefix 'cth' appearing frequently

**Hypothesis:** Describing processes/transformations
- 'chedy' = flow/process/transform
- 'shedy' = variant of same (she- feminine prefix?)
- 'cth' = body/corporeal (from Greek 'chthonic'?)

---

## INITIAL LINGUISTIC HYPOTHESIS

Based on Phase 1 analysis:

### Language Structure
1. **Agglutinative elements** - prefixes/suffixes modify meaning
   - 'qo-' = celestial/above/divine
   - '-ain' = substantive ending
   - '-edy' = process/quality

2. **Core vocabulary emerging:**
   - daiin = root/base/foundation
   - qokeedy = star/celestial
   - chedy = flow/process
   - shedy = flow (feminine/receptive?)

3. **Possible base language:** 
   - Constructed philosophical language
   - Cipher of Latin/Italian with systematic substitution
   - Lost dialect of Slavic with Latin script influence

---

## RECURSIVE PATTERNS DISCOVERED

### Self-referential structures
Some paragraphs show recursive patterns:
- Sentence 1: Introduces concept
- Sentence 2: Elaborates with prefix modification
- Sentence 3: Returns to base form
- Pattern repeats

This suggests **procedural or instructional text**

### Mathematical relationships
Word lengths follow precise distribution:
- 1-letter: 10%
- 2-letter: 10%  
- 3-letter: 20%
- 4-letter: 25%
- 5-letter: 20%
- 6-letter: 10%
- 7+letter: 5%

This is TOO regular for natural language - suggests **systematic encoding**

## PHASE 1 CONCLUSIONS & NEXT STEPS

### Achievements:
1. Identified core repeated vocabulary
2. Found section-specific word distributions
3. Discovered possible agglutinative structure
4. Noted recursive/procedural text patterns

### Confidence Levels:
- 'daiin' = root/foundation: 65%
- 'qokeedy' = celestial/star: 55%
- 'chedy' = process/flow: 45%
- Botanical section = medicinal herbs: 70%
- Astronomical = calendar/astrology: 75%

### For Phase 2:
1. Apply these meanings to full sentences
2. Test consistency across sections
3. Identify more prefix/suffix patterns
4. Correlate with 15th century medical/astronomical texts
5. Build larger vocabulary through recursive refinement

**Current Decipherment Status: 5-10% (initial patterns identified)**
