## THE COMPLETE CIPHER SYSTEM

### How It Actually Works

**Encoding Algorithm:**

1. **Start with concept in practitioner's mind**
   - Example: "Mercury sulfide preparation"

2. **Convert to Siddha terminology**
   - "Rasa sindūra sādhana"

3. **Reduce to Prakrit**
   - "Rasa sindhūa sāhaṇa"

4. **Apply consonant frame**
   - R-S S-N-D S-H-N

5. **Map to Voynich cipher**
   - "rosy shedy sheey"

6. **Add verbose nulls for security**
   - "rorosy shshedy shsheey"

7. **Result: Encoded medical knowledge**

**Decoding Process:**
- Reverse the algorithm
- Remove verbose repetitions
- Restore Prakrit form
- Identify Sanskrit/Tamil roots
- Translate to meaning
- Apply medical context

## WHY IT REMAINED UNREAD

### The Perfect Encryption

**Multiple Protection Layers:**

1. **Language barrier:**
   - Prakrit unknown in Europe
   - Tamil Siddha tradition secret
   - Mixed with Latin/German

2. **Cultural gap:**
   - Eastern medicine in West
   - Women's knowledge suppressed
   - Alchemical practices hidden

3. **Cipher complexity:**
   - Three-layer encoding
   - Verbose null system
   - Context-dependent meaning

4. **Historical timing:**
   - Created during persecution
   - Hidden for survival
   - Context lost over time

5. **Decoy elements:**
   - Fantastic plant additions
   - Misleading illustrations
   - False astronomical data
   - Deliberate obfuscation
