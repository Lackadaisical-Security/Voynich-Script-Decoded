## THE DEEPER PATTERN

### Universal Healing Knowledge

The Voynich reveals that despite surface differences, **human medical knowledge converges** on:
- Similar disease understanding
- Common preparation methods
- Shared medicinal plants
- Universal timing systems
- Comparable diagnostics

This suggests either:
1. **Independent discovery** of medical truths
2. **Ancient knowledge diffusion** through trade
3. **Universal human biological responses**
4. **Cognitive medical universals**
5. **All of the above**
